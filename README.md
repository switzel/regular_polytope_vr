# Vietoris-Rips complexes of regular polytopes

Currently this repository contains a single file of GAP code that was used to find and verify a partial acyclic matching on the Vietoris-Rips complex with radius 3 of the dodecahedron. This is used in the article "Vietoris-Rips complexes of Platonic solids" by Nada Saleh, Thomas Titz Mite, and Stefan Witzel.
